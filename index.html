The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
 Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked
by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources
of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
and are published by a software application called a web server.
 The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated
 the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies
 of which the Web is built.
